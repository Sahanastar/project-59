		<p1>. Reading could help you live longer
			People who read books live for around two years longer than those who don’t, irrespective of gender, wealth, education or health, according to a Yale University study. While a similar association was found among readers of newspapers, it was weaker.
			“Book reading contributed to a survival advantage that was significantly greater than that observed for reading newspapers or magazines,” the authors of the study wrote. “Compared to non-book readers, book readers had a 23-month survival advantage,” they noted.Deep reading promotes empathy and emotional intelligence - cognitive processes that can lead to greater chance of survival</p1>

		<p> My favorite hobby is to read book. Books are our best friends. They give imformation about our surrinding and some subject books like biology give imformation about self.
			Hearing the words out loud helps many students gain a better understanding of what they are reading than they are able to get while reading in their head Reading other people’s stories about their journeys in life can give you better perspective of what the journey of change can be about.</p>

		<p>Life becomes a little simpler when you accept that as we pursue our goals, there will inevitably be challenges and barriers along the way. This is why a few extra sources of inspiration, such as motivational books, never hurt anyone.All personal breakthroughs begin with a change in beliefs. So how do we change? The most effective way is to get your brain to associate massive pain to the old belief. You must feel deep in your gut that not only has this belief cost you pain in the past, but it’s costing you in the present and, ultimately, can only bring you pain in the future. Then you must associate tremendous pleasure to the idea of adopting an empowering new belief
